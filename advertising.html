The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA), the body which represents advertising agencies, defines advertising as:
<br>
<br>
"The means of providing the most persuasive possible selling message to the right prospects at the lowest possible cost".
<br>
<br>There are five main stages in a well-managed advertising campaign:
<b>Stage 1: Set Advertising Objectives</b>
An advertising objective is a specific communication task to be achieved with a specific target audience during a specified period of time. Advertising objectives fall into three main categories:
(a) To inform - e.g. tell customers about a new product
(b) To persuade - e.g. encourage customers to switch to a different brand
(c) To remind - e.g. remind buyers where to find a product
<b>Stage 2: Set the Advertising Budget</b>
Marketers should remember that the role of advertising is to create demand for a product. <br>
The amount spent on advertising should be relevant to the potential sales impact of the campaign.<br>
 This, in turn will reflect the characteristics of the product being advertised.<br>
For example, new products tend to need a larger advertising budget to help build<br> 
awareness and to encourage consumers to trial the product. A product that is highly differentiated <br>
may also need more advertising to help set it apart from the competition - emphasising <br>
the points of difference.Setting the advertising budget is not easy - how can a business<br>
 predict the right amount to spend. Which parts of the advertising campaign will work best<br>
 and which will have relatively little effect? Often businesses use "rules-of-thumb"<br>
 (e.g. advertising/sales ratio) as a guide to set the budget.<br>
<b>Stage 3: Determine the key Advertising Messages</b><br>
Spending a lot on advertising does not guarantee success <br>
(witness the infamous John Cleese campaign for Sainsbury). <br>
Research suggests that the clarity of the advertising message is often more <br>important than the amount spent. The advertising message must be carefully <br>
targeted to impact the target customer audience. A successful advertising message <br>
should have the following characteristics:<br>
(a) Meaningful - customers should find the message relevant<br>
(b) Distinctive - capture the customer's attention<br>
(c) Believable - a difficult task, since research suggests most consumers doubt the truth of advertising in general<br>
<b>Stage 4: Decide which Advertising Media to Use</b><br>
There are a variety of advertising media from which to chose. A campaign<br>
 may use one or more of the media alternatives. The key factors in choosing the right media include:<br>
(a) Reach - what proportion of the target customers will be exposed to the advertising?<br>
(b) Frequency - how many times will the target customer be exposed to the advertising message?<br>
(c) Media Impact - where, if the target customer sees the message - will it have most impact? <br>
For example does an advert promoting holidays for elderly people have more impact on Television (if so, <br>when and which channels) or in a national newspaper or perhaps a magazine focused on this segment of the population?<br>
Another key decision in relation to advertising media relates to the timing of the campaign. Some products are <br>
particularly suited to seasonal campaigns on television (e.g. Christmas hampers) <br>whereas for other products, a regular advertising campaign throughout the year in media <br>
such as newspapers and specialist magazines (e.g. cottage holidays in the Lake District) is more appropriate.<br>
<b>Stage 5: Evaluate the results of the Advertising Campaign</b><br>
The evaluation of an advertising campaign should focus on two key areas:<br>
(1) The Communication Effects - is the intended message being communicated effectively and to the intended audience?<br>
(2) The Sales Effects - has the campaign generated the intended sales growth. This second area is much more difficult to measure.</th>
