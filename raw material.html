Even though goldy started his business with old potatoes, today's product is made from farm-fresh potatoes delivered daily to manufacturing plants. The sources vary from season to season. In April <br>and May, potatoes come from UP AND MP; June, July and August bring potatoes from RAJASTHAN and DELHI; in the autumn months, the AGRA supply the majority of potatoes; during <br>the winter, potato chip manufacturers depend on their stored supplies of potatoes. Stored potatoes are kept <br>at a constant temperature, between 40-45°F (4.4-7.2°C), until several weeks before <br>they are to be used. They are then moved to a reconditioning room that is heated to 70-75°F (21.1-23.9°C). <br>Size and type are important in potato selection. White potatoes that are larger than a <br>golf ball, but smaller than a baseball, are the best. It takes 100 lb (45.4 kg) of raw potatoes to produce 25 lb (11.3 kg) of chips.

<br>The potatoes are fried in either corn oil, cottonseed oil, or a blend of vegetable oils. An antioxidizing agent is <br>added to the oil to prevent rancidity. To further insure purification, the oil is passed <br>through a filtration system daily. Salt and other flavoring ingredients, such as powdered sour cream and onion <br>and barbecue flavor, are purchased from outside sources. Flake salt is used rather <br>than crystal salt. Some manufacturers treat the potatoes with chemicals such as phosphoric acid, citric acid,<br> hydrochloric acid, or calcium chloride to reduce the sugar level, and thus improve the <br>product's color but in goldy chips natural flavored are used not chemical. The bags are designed and <br>printed by the TMT potato chip manufacturer. They are stored on rolls and brought to the<br> assembly line as necessary.
